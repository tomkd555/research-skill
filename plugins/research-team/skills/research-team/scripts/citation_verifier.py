"""citation_verifier.py - machine verification of the citations in evidence_log.json.

Used in research-team Step 3 (independent verification) and Step 5 (machine audit). It
checks the HTTP reachability of every source URL, resolves DOIs and arXiv IDs, and matches
each verbatim_quote against the body of its source. Standard library only (it uses the
network).

The checks run in parallel under a per-host throttle (--workers, 8 by default). The interval
between requests to one host stays at REQUEST_INTERVAL, the same as the serial version, so
the load any one server sees is unchanged. The output follows the input order (evidence ID
order) and is deterministic.

Examples:
    python citation_verifier.py evidence_log.json
    python citation_verifier.py evidence_log.json --only E1,E3 --json
    python citation_verifier.py evidence_log.json --workers 1
    python citation_verifier.py evidence_log.json --offline
    python citation_verifier.py --sample > evidence_log.json

Output: citation_check.json, written by default to the directory of the input file. Every
evidence ID carries a severity (PASS/WARN/CRITICAL). A not_found result (the quote does not
match, or the DOI/arXiv ID does not resolve) is a CRITICAL candidate; the final call belongs
to the auditor agent. This script never rewrites evidence_log.json itself - writing verdicts
back is the parent's and the verifier's job.

Exit codes: 0 = PASS or WARN only / 1 = at least one CRITICAL / 2 = usage or I/O error
